//Readme documentation for validationFramework

The framework consists of two parts. 

1. There is an object (expr) with keys that are regex expressions. These are to be used with a generic test function in the framework called "exprTest(input, regExp)". You would add your input to test as a parameter and the regex to test against (i.e "expr.alpha" to check for all alpha characters).

2. Also included are a few formatting functions. an example is "formatPhone(phone)" where you just add the phone number string as a parameter. 

As more is added, the documentation will be updated.
